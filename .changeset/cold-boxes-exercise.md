Adds support for Safari.

Starting with version 18.2, Safari introduced support for cross-document view transitions but still lacks support for the Navigation API.

As of version 1.1.0, Element-Crossing now handles Safari as well, again enabling the transfer of selected element states across cross-document view transitions in all browsers that support this feature.
